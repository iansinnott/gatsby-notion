# Gatsby Notion

This is a project for using a Notion database (collection) as a CMS. As of this writing there are two things here:

- [gatsby-source-notion-collection](packages/gatsby-source-notion-collection)
  - The core of this project at present. This gatsby plugin will pull data from a notion table and transform any row contents into HTML.
- [gatsby-notion-example](packages/gatsby-notion-example)
  - An example using the gatsby plugin above.

You can also see a real example of this project by viewing the source of my blog:
